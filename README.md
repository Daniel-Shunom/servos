## A simple serveless to do app built entirely in gleam

Being curious about the **gleam web dev tooling**, I was inspired by [gleaming.dev](https://gleaming.dev/)
and built on top of the existing tutorial

### A short promo for the gleam language

- It's nice looking
- It's fault tolerant
- It has greate type safety
- It's built on the BEAM
- Plus lucy is the coolest mascot ever, I mean come on, look at em

Any way I hope you 1. learn from this project, or 2. try gleam today!

### **This project is intended as a learing experience for gleam web dev so keep that in mind if you do decide to clone the repo**
